<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>Silicon Valley is the undeniable <i>Center of the Universe</i> when
it comes to computers. A great deal of what we now take for granted

began here, from Hewlett-Packard, to Intel, Apple, Google, and many
other companies, it's hard to deny that this area was not pivotal to
computer innovation. So isn't it time that the premier library coding
conference finally make a pilgrimage to this computer hardware and
software version of Mecca?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley#Origin_of_the_term">Wikipedia</a>, "The "valley" in its name refers to the Santa
Clara Valley in Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose
and surrounding cities and towns, where the region has been
traditionally centered."</p>

<p>And let's not forget <a href="https://weatherspark.com/m/1098/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-San-Jose-California-United-States">the weather</a> in mid-February California.</p>

<h1>Location: San José, California</h1>

<p>San José is the largest city in the Bay Area (and the 10th largest in
the United States). A cultural and technological gem, San José has a
walkable downtown, fast and free public wifi, a vibrant and diverse
community of art and activism, great restaurants at a wide variety of
price points, and one-of-a-kind museums. San José has an <a href="http://flysanjose.com/">international
airport</a>, and is connected to Santa
Clara light rail. It is home to many
tech companies and a number of unique attractions, including the <a href="http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/">Winchester Mystery
House</a> and <a href="https://www.cagreatamerica.com/">Great America</a>
amusement park.</p>

<p>More importantly, there are several brewpubs in downtown San José.</p>

<h1>Honoring the People Whose Lands We Will Meet On</h1>

<p>The conference will take place on lands originally inhabited by the <a href="http://www.muwekma.org/">Muwekma Ohlone Tribe</a>. We wish to acknowledge this
and thank them.</p>


<h1>Financial Sketch</h1>

<p>DLF/CLIR has kindly offered to be the financial sponsor no matter
what the result of the vote is. We will likely hire Concentra to manage
the conference. We expect a financial surplus from Code4Lib 2018 which
can help make the initial downpayments to confirm the venue. We expect, as for past conferences, something along these lines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Registration fee between $200-250</li>
    <li>Hotel rates at or below $225 at the conference hotel, with nearby cheaper options</li>
    <li>Up to 470 attendees</li>
</ul>

<p>As with past conferences, we are committed to work hard to raise
funds to keep the cost as low as possible for attendees.</p>

<h1>Transportation</h1>

<p>The San José International Airport (SJC) is only 3 miles from
downtown San José. Transportation options from the airport
include airport shuttles, taxis (approximately $20-25), and several
major rental car vendors. The cheapest option would be to take the free
<a href="http://www.vta.org/routes/rt10">VTA Airport Flyer Shuttle</a>
to the Metro/Airport Light Rail station for fast and frequent service
downtown. The bus lines 23, 168, 323 go to the San José
Convention Center stop.</p>

<p>Other airport options include San Francisco International (SFO) and
Oakland International (OAK), both approximately 38 miles north of the
conference venue.</p>

<p>For getting around downtown there are <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=5107">many options</a> including free shuttles.</p>
